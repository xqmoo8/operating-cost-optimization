# Power Management Algorithm in All-Electric Ships

To address the Optimal Power Management of Shipboard power system (OPMS) problem, an optimal management algorithm based on Benders decomposition
(BD) is designed to split it into two more tractable problems (subproblem and master problem). Due to the slow convergence caused by the time-coupled
constraints, a low-complexity near-optimal algorithm based on BD (LNBD) is proposed by decomposing the time-coupled constraints with suboptimal power
allocation of ESMs and propulsion modules in the subproblem. A complexity analysis is given to compare the performance of two algorithms in [1].

<!-- This work is used for optimizing the operating cost of MVDC shipboard power system. Especially, it can solve the problem in normal and failure mode. -->
